Robo-browser
------------

This directory contains the code for a Python/Selenium-based spider that will
browse the internet with the ScriptObservatory extension activated.


Roadmap:
--------
- ~~first pass implementation~~
- enable autocomparing pages loaded with/without extension for bug reports
- expose an API to give the robo-browser tasks via the website
