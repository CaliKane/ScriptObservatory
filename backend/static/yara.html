    Yara-scanning is in test/experimental mode.

    Please don't submit more than one request at a time. If it starts bringing down the server I'll have to turn it off :-(
    <br><br>
    If a request takes longer than 20 minutes, it will be killed... you can send me an email and I'll take a look to see why it's taking so long.
