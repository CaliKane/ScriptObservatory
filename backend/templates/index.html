    <h3><i>Basic Information</i></h3>
    The goal of the ScriptObservatory project is to extend the idea behind the <a href="https://www.eff.org/observatory" target="_blank">SSL Observatory</a>
    by recording information about the JavaScript, iframes, and other resources people are seeing on the Internet.
    <br><br>
    The long-term goal of this website is for it to be a place where anyone can analyze a record of what people have been sent while on 
    the Internet. The long-term goal for the Chrome extension is to crowdsource the data collection and to act as a <b><i>content-aware</i></b> 
    resource filter that can be used while browsing the web.
    <br><br>

    Most of the coding is in Python (backend, analysis tools, scanning automation tools),  HTML & AngularJS (webpage), and plain JavaScript (chrome extension). All the code is on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andy11/ScriptObservatory">GitHub</a>.
