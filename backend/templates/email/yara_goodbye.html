This message is to notify you that your Yara rule has been removed from the database. This happens when you 
request that your rule be removed or when the rule runs out of email tokens.

<br><br>

If you weren't wanting for this rule to be removed, try 
<a href="https://yara.readthedocs.org/en/latest/writingrules.html">refining your Yara rule</a> to be more 
specific. Information on the "email token" rate limiting system can be found on 
<a href="https://scriptobservatory.org/yara.html">the main Yara webpage</a>.

<br> <br>

For your records, the content of the removed rule is:

<br>

<pre>{{ rule.source }}</pre>

<br>

As always, feel free to <a href="mailto:scriptobservatory@gmail.com">send me an email</a> if you have thoughts on how the system could be made better.

<br><br>

Cheers,

<br><br>

Andy
